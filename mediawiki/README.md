# Mediawiki installation

This directory includes files need to install mediawiki on top of dweb-mirror

The process is still only semi-automated, in part because mediawiki makes it soooo hard to automate,
and there is essentially no community support. 

#### Files
* install_mediawiki.sh - a script that installs mediawiki, 
  or rather talks someone thru the instal.
* mediawiki.conf - file used by install_mediawiki.si
