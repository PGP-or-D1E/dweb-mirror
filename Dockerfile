# This should work, but AFAIK noone is currently using dweb-mirror under Docker so if not please send post a bug report or PR

# Docker reference: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/
# Building
# > cd ...dweb-mirror
# > docker image build --no-cache -t mitraardron/dweb-mirror:latest .   # Use no-cache or it might not rebuild from a changed npm
# > docker push mitraardron/dweb-mirror:latest                          # Send to repo
#
# For testing
# > docker run -i -p 4244:4244 --name internetarchive mitraardron/dweb-mirror:latest           # Test it
# > docker run -i -p 4244:4244 --name internetarchive mitraardron/dweb-mirror:latest /bin/bash # OR run bash inside it
#
# For production
# > docker run -d â€”name internetarchive -p 4244:4244 mitraardron/dweb-mirror:latest    # Run production
# > docker container stop mirrorHttp                                        # Stop running server
# > docker container rm mirrorHttp                                          # Delete container
# > docker logs mirrorHttp                                                  # See the logs
